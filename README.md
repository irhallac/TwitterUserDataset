# TwitterUserDataset

<h2> 500K Tweets collected from 500 Twitter users' timelines. </h2>

Each user belongs to one of the 5 predefined categories: Economy, Crypto Economy, Technology, Fashion, and Politics.


Tweets are not publicly shared due to Twitter API’s Terms of Service.  Because "Twitter does not allow for making large amounts of raw Twitter data available on the Web" [1]

In order to get the actual Text of the tweets you should rehydrate them with their IDs. You can use a tool like Twarch [2] for harvesting Tweets. Please contact to corresponding author for the list of ids used in the paper.
